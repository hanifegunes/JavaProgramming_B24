        flow of for loop:
        it executes the initialization part to declare the variable;

        ==checks the boolean / termination condition part
        i<=10 ->

        if the boolean false ;the loop stops;

        next i++ =11,

        next the loop body,statements inside of the loop
        System.out.println(i)

         System.out.println(i) we can not print it outside of the loop
